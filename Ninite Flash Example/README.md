# Ninite - Flash

This is a basic example script for running a Ninite installer through LabTech silently. You will need Ninite Pro for this to work and will most likely need to change the file path.

This can be expanded by just replacing the names with other software and downloading a new Ninite executable from their site with the proper programs selected.

Script is located at Software > +Ninite Installers after import.
